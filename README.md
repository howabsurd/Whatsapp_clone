# WhatsApp Clone

Welcome to the WhatsApp Clone project! This project is a React-based web application that replicates some of the core features of the popular messaging app, WhatsApp. It utilizes Firebase for backend services, Google Authentication for user security, and React Context with reducers for global state management. The application is hosted on Firebase Hosting.

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can register and log in using their Google accounts for secure access.

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Users can send and receive messages in real time with any other registered user.

- **Firebase Backend**: The project uses Firebase Firestore for storing messages and user data, ensuring scalability and reliability.

## Future Scopes

We have ambitious plans for the future development of this project:

1. **Groups**: We aim to implement group chat functionality, allowing users to create and manage group conversations.

2. **Attachments**: We plan to enable users to send attachments like images, videos, and documents within chat conversations.

3. **Search Bar**: A search bar will be added to help users quickly find messages and contacts in their chat history.

4. **User Profile Customization**: Users will have the option to customize their profile pictures and status messages.

5. **Message Encryption**: Enhanced security with end-to-end encryption for user privacy.

6. **Message Reactions and Replies**: Users will be able to react to messages with emojis and reply to specific messages in a thread.
